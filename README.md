*/
1. XCode Version 12.3, iOS 14.3 for iPhone 11 Pro
2. I focused primarily on the architecture and data flow. The UI is not amazing, but displays all the data neccessary, 
and I arranged the UI a readable/understandable way programmatically. I created custom classes for Buttons, and used Codable for
to recieve the data and converting the json data into my custom class
3. I copied in my RemoteImageHandler, from my app FoodMoods to convert the smallPhotoUrl and largePhotoUr, which is noted in the comments.
4. Phone focused
5. In this project I decided to challenge myself. I learned and utilized CoreData for the first time, previously I had used 
RealmSwift for local caching.
